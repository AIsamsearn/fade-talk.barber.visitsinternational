# fade-tal# 💈✂️ BARBERING IS NOT JUST A JOB — IT’S WHO I AM ✂️💈  
### From 🇱🇧 LEBANON to the WORLD 🌍 — 18 Years of Blood, Sweat, and Style

👊 This is not just about **haircuts**...  
This is **art**, this is **discipline**, this is a **lifestyle** I paid for since my childhood.  
While others were playing, I was grinding. While others were dreaming, I was bleeding for this.

I didn’t learn this from YouTube.  
I learned it from the **streets**, from **real people**, from **pain**, and from **purpose**.

## 🧠 THIS IS DEEPER THAN SCISSORS

💈 Every fade I do tells a story.  
✂️ Every line I cut has meaning.  
🔥 Every client leaves not just fresh — but **reborn**.

Because when you sit in my chair,  
You’re not just getting a haircut —  
You’re getting a piece of **18 years** of soul, fire, and love for this craft.

> **This is how I learned to trust myself.**  
> **This is how I turned pain into power.**  
> **And this is how I’ll teach you to do the same.**
